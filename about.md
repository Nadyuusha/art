# About

This gallery is a quiet archive of paintings by a single artist. The work focuses on light, negative space, and slow observation.

## Practice

- **Medium:** oil and pigment on linen  
- **Process:** layered glazes and restrained palette  
- **Themes:** stillness, domestic light, and weathered surfaces  

## Statement

I paint to slow time. Each canvas is a study in restraint — a small room where color can breathe.

## Exhibitions

Selected works are released in small series and documented here as they are completed.
